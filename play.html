        <h3>The Duchess of Padua</h3>
        <h5>ACT V</h5>
        <h6>
            _A dungeon in the public prison of Padua_; _Guido lies asleep on a
            pallet_ (_L.C._); _a table with a goblet on it is set_ (_L.C._); _five
            soldiers are drinking and playing dice in the corner on a stone table_;
            _one of them has a lantern hung to his halbert_; _a torch is set in the
            wall over Guidoâ€™s head_.  _Two grated windows behind_, _one on each side
            of the door which is_ (_C._), _look out into the passage_; _the stage is
            rather dark_.

            SECOND SOLDIER

            They say the Duchess wanted to pardon him.
         
         FIRST SOLDIER
         
            Is that so?
         
         SECOND SOLDIER
         
            Ay, and did much entreat the Lord Justice, but he would not.
         
         FIRST SOLDIER
         
            I had thought, Pietro, that the Duchess was omnipotent.
         
         SECOND SOLDIER
         
            True, she is well-favoured; I know none so comely.
         
         THE SOLDIERS
         
            Ha! ha! ha!
         
         FIRST SOLDIER
         
            I meant I had thought our Duchess could do anything.
         
         SECOND SOLDIER
         
            Nay, for he is now given over to the Justices, and they will see that
            justice be done; they and stout Hugh the headsman; but when his head
            is off, why then the Duchess can pardon him if she likes; there is no
            law against that.
         
         FIRST SOLDIER
         
            I do not think that stout Hugh, as you call him, will do the business
            for him after all.  This Guido is of gentle birth, and so by the law
            can drink poison first, if it so be his pleasure.
         
         THIRD SOLDIER
         
            And if he does not drink it?
         
         FIRST SOLDIER
         
            Why, then, they will kill him.
         
                                                    [_Knocking comes at the door_.]
